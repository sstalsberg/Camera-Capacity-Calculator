Introduction
The Camera-Capacity-Calculator is a comprehensive tool developed in Microsoft Power Apps, designed to assist photographers, videographers, and content creators in efficiently managing their storage needs. This application allows users to calculate the storage requirements for their video files in megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), or terabytes (TB), taking into account various camera brands, models, and the supported codecs. It provides flexibility by enabling calculations based on duration (seconds, minutes, hours) or by specifying the memory card capacity to determine how much footage it can hold. Additionally, it estimates the transfer time required to move data from one storage type to another, enhancing workflow efficiency.

Features
Brand and Model Selection: Choose from a wide range of camera brands and models to ensure accurate storage calculation.
Codec Support: Supports various codecs, offering precise calculations based on the selected camera's compatibility.
Flexible Duration Inputs: Calculate storage needs by specifying the duration in seconds, minutes, or hours.
Memory Card Capacity Utilization: Determine how many minutes of footage can fit on a given memory card size.
Transfer Time Estimation: Calculate the time it takes to transfer your data from one storage medium to another, planning your post-production workflow more effectively.
How to Use
Select Camera Brand and Model: Begin by selecting your camera's brand and model from the dropdown menus to ensure the calculator uses the correct data.

Choose Codec: Pick the codec used to shoot your footage. This is crucial for an accurate calculation as different codecs have different storage requirements.

Input Duration or Memory Card Size:

For duration-based calculation, enter the time in seconds, minutes, or hours to find out the storage needs.
For memory card capacity, specify the size of your card to calculate how much footage it can hold.
Calculate Transfer Time: Enter the details of your source and destination storage types to estimate the transfer time.

View Results: The app will display the required storage space in MB, GB, or TB and the estimated transfer time.
