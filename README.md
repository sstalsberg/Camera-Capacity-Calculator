Introduction

The Camera Capacity Calculator (CCC) is developed in Microsoft Power Apps, designed to assist videographers, and content creators to efficiently managing their storage needs. This application let you choose various camera brands, models, and the supported codecs for that model. It provides flexibility by enabling calculations based on duration (seconds, minutes, hours) or by specifying the memory card capacity to determine how many minutes of footage it can hold. Additionally, it estimates the transfer time required to move data from one storage type to another.
